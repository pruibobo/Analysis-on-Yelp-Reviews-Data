## Introduction
There are tens of thousands of reviews for different types of businesses on Yelp. Our analysis mainly focuses on restaurants which serve steak in several US cities. We are trying to extract some insights from this reviews data and propose data-driven recommendations for steak restaurant owners to improve their ratings on Yelp based on our results.

## Procedure
Limited by the computing power, we chose to focus on restaurants whose category contained the word "steak".

- Cleaned txt data from Yelp reviews following Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps using NLTK in Python.
- Performed exploratory data analysis by making plots of rating distributions and got some useful insights.
- Performed t-tests on business attributes and fitted a multiple linear regression model using word frequencies.
- Proposed data-driven recommendations and actionable plans based on our results.
- Built a Shiny application to further demonstrate our results.
